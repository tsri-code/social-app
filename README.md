# Project 9: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
This project is made as a mockup profile page for social purposes. Users can add new posts, like, and edit their profile. It is a responsive page for multiple device sizes.

The alternate branch of 'old version' is an old attempt at Project 6 which I have scrapped. I have spoken to my counsellor about restarting Project 6 and it was approved. main branch is the current one.

The branch project 9 is the branch to work off of for the API

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
